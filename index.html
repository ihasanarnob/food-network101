                    <h3>The Best Chicken-Rice</h3>
                    <p>
                        Could classic chicken and rice be one of the most beloved comfort dinners to ever hit the plate?
                        We think so. And to blow your mind even more, this version is made in just one skillet. Here we
                        use bone-in, skin on chicken thighs which cook up in exactly the same time as the rice to
                        guarantee juicy chicken. A quick broil at the end creates the perfect crispy skin and gives a
                        little crunch to the rice and vegetables.

                        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Mix the brown sugar, paprika,
                        garlic powder, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a generous amount of freshly ground
                        black pepper in a small bowl. Mix the panko with the parsley, butter, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
                        and a few grinds of black pepper in another small bowl.

                        Make the pork: Combine the paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, the brown sugar,
                        cumin, mustard powder, onion powder and garlic powder in a bowl. Rub the olive oil all over

                        refrigerate 3 to 6 hours.
