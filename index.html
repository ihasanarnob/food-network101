                    <h3>The Best Chicken-Rice</h3>
                    <p>
                        Could classic chicken and rice be one of the most beloved comfort dinners to ever hit the plate?
                        We think so. And to blow your mind even more, this version is made in just one skillet. Here we
                        use bone-in, skin on chicken thighs which cook up in exactly the same time as the rice to
                        guarantee juicy chicken. A quick broil at the end creates the perfect crispy skin and gives a
                        little crunch to the rice and vegetables.

                    <h3>Easy Baked Salmon</h3>
                    <p>
                        This simple baked salmon really hits all the right notes: tangy, sweet, savory, a little spicy
                        and crunchy. Cooking a larger piece makes for a nice presentation. Topped with buttery golden
                        breadcrumbs and parsley, it's perfect for a weeknight dinner yet fancy enough to serve to
                        guests.

                    <p>
                        This sheet pan dinner is loaded with summer corn, tomatoes, fennel and shrimp. The whole thing
                        is broiled together, so you can have it on the table in a flash. Top with feta, fresh basil and
                        a squeeze of lemon juice for the perfect summer weeknight meal.
